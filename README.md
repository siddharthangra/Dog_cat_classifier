  A trial CNN project, to understand the functioning and training of CNN model and understanding the deployment pipeline of the ML and DL models.
  This Model, has been trained on 40k dataset, with 20k images being original improted from keras and 20k augmented to decrease the Overfitting in our model.
  Trained on VGG model, with first 2 epoch training the newly designed ANN structure and rest of epoch, training the last conv layers again on the data.
  Model acheives a Val_accuracy of 96 percent.
  The model is deployed on Render, even though there are issues pertaining to Computational time out at webserver but users can hover on a simplistic website, to look how things work as well.
  This trial Project will help me in using better MLops options next time, while giving me hands on experience time by time.
